Data types in JAVA:

1. Primitive data type:
-> Primitive data type (size of the data type is known by the compiler)
-> It's decided at compile time and created in stack memory area
-> No polymorphism is possible
-> 8 members under the primitive data type

1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. char
5. float
6. double
7. long
8. boolean

-> Primitive data types are strongly typed

2. Reference data type:
-> Reference Data type (size is unknown by compiler)
-> So compiler has got nothing 2 do
-> So only JVM/JRE can create them only at run time - taken from HEAP memory area
-> Dynamic in nature
-> 5 members under the reference data type

1. class
2. interface
3. enum (from java 5)
4. array
5. record (from java 16)

-> Every data type can be used as
1. Local variable
2. Instance variable
3. Static variable
