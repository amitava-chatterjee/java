FunctionalInterface is introduced in Java 1.8

1. Predicate -> only returns boolean result
2. Consumer -> no result only modifies data
3. Function -> input and output
4. Supplier -> no input only supply

There is a concept of BiXXX:
1. BiPredicate -> takes 2 arguments only returns boolean result
2. BiConsumer -> takes 2 arguments and doesn't give result only modifies data
3. BiFunction -> takes 2 arguments as input and gives output

NOTE:
1. There are no concept of TriXXX or QuadXXX
2. Java 1.8 has inbuilt FunctionalInterface that can take only 1-2 arguments and not more than that
