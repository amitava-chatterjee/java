### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The principle states that the larger interfaces split into smaller ones cz the implementation classes use only the methods that are required, do not force any client to use the methods which is irrelevant to them or they do not want to use.

**The goal of this principle is similar to the Liskov Substitution Principle.**
