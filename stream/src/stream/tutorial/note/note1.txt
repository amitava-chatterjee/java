What are Stream?
1. If we want to process bulk objects of a collection then we should go for Stream
2. Way to operate or crawl over collections in Java 1.8 is Stream
3. It is a special iterator class that allows processing collections of objects in a functional manner

NOTE:
It is important to know that java.io.InputStream or all the XXXStream classes we have inside java.io package is completely different from the classes we have inside java.util.stream

1. java.io.XXXStream is sequence of characters or binary data which is used to write something to a file or to read data from a file
2. Whereas java.util.stream.* from Java 1.8 is no where related to files, it helps us to process or perform bulk operations on each & every object in a collection in an efficient way
