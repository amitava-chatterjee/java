Difference between filter and map:

filter:
- If we want to fetch/filter objects from a collection and then create a different Stream object with those filtered objects then we use filter
- Syntax: collection.stream().filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)

map:
- If we want to perform some operation on each object rather filtering those objects and then create a different Stream object with updated objects (after operation is performed) (basically mapped all updated objects to that Stream) then we use map
- Syntax: collection.stream().map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper)

N.B.: filter and map is nothing but configuration of Stream object
