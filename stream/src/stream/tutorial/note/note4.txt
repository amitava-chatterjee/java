Intermediate operation:
- The operations which return another stream as a result are called intermediate operations
- Intermediate operations are generally lazy
- eg: filter(), map(), distinct(), sorted(), limit(), skip()

Terminal operation:
- The operations which return non-stream values like primitive or collection or return nothing are called terminal operations
- You can chain multiple intermediate operations and none of them will do anything until you invoke a terminal operation. At the time, all the intermediate operation that you invoked earlier will be invoked along with the terminal operation
- eg: forEach(), toArray(), reduce(), collect(), min(), max(), count(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch(), findFirst(), findAny()
